# Playlist Recommendation Demo

This project is a demo application that recommends songs based on a user-provided playlist title.  
It uses a fine-tuned transformer model trained on the Million Playlist Dataset to generate real-time suggestions that match the theme of the input.

The system is fully packaged in a Docker image and includes:
- A Flask backend API
- A clean, interactive web interface
- Preloaded data, embeddings, and model (no extra setup required)
