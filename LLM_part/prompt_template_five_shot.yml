  You are an expert in musical playlist generation. Your task is to generate the continuation of a playlist given only its Title and five example songs with their artists.

  ### Important:
  - You have to take only songs that were released before October 2017.
  - Propose a COMPLETE playlist made of 10 songs.
  - Do not output any extra text besides the list of songs.
  - The output must be a JSON list where each item is a dictionary with keys "song" and "artist".
  - Only return the JSON list. Do not repeat the instructions or inputs.
  - IMPORTANT: In each dictionary, the value for "song" must contain only the song name (without any hyphen or artist information) and the value for "artist" must contain only the artist name.
  - All recommended songs must be UNIQUE and must not repeat any of the five example songs provided
  
  Playlist Title: "{playlist_title}"

  Examples:
  1. {{"song": "{song1}", "artist": "{artist1}"}}
  2. {{"song": "{song2}", "artist": "{artist2}"}}
  3. {{"song": "{song3}", "artist": "{artist3}"}}
  4. {{"song": "{song4}", "artist": "{artist4}"}}
  5. {{"song": "{song5}", "artist": "{artist5}"}}

  Output format (strict):
  [
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}},
    {{"song": "<song name>", "artist": "<artist>"}}
  ]

  Answer ONLY with the JSON list exactly as specified above. Do not output anything else.
